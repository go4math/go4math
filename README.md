- 👋 Hi, I’m @go4math
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang and probably will pick up Japanese too :P
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python/golang backend projects, and hopefully not screw them up :P
- 📫 You may find me via leetcode-cn.com under same ID, where I practice algorithm tricks almost every day
